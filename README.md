`Nginx` (pronounced "engine-x") is an open source reverse proxy server for HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols, as well as a load balancer, HTTP cache, and a web server (origin server).

`Certbot` is a free, open source software tool for automatically using [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates on manually-administrated websites to enable HTTPS.

## How to use

### Basic Usage

The following sample shows how to run the container to request a certificate for multiple domains.

```bash
docker run -dt \
  --name reverse-server \
  -p 80:80 \
  -p 443:443 \
  -v $(PWD)/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt \
  -v $(PWD)/certbot:/usr/share/nginx/certbot \
  -e EMAIL="myemail@mycompany.com" \
  -e DOMAINS="mycompany.com www.mycompany.com" \
  touchify/nginx-certbot
```

### Configuration

 * **EMAIL:** Sets the email to use to request Let's Encrypt certificates.
 * **DOMAINS:** Sets the domain(s) to request from Let's Encrypt. For multiple domains, separated by spaces.
 * **STAGING:** Sets to `1` to use certbot in staging mode.
